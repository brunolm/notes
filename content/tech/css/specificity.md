## What is Specificity?

Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.

## How to calculate Specificity?

Specificity is calculated by the browser based on the selectors that are used to target the element and the order in which they are applied. The following list of selector types is by increasing order of specificity:
